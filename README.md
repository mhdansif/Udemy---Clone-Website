# Udemy---Clone-Website

Udemy Clone Website is a frontend project developed using HTML5 and CSS3 that replicates the layout and core design of the popular online learning platform Udemy. This clone features a clean and responsive interface that includes a navigation bar, course search functionality, categorized course listings, promotional sections, trending course recommendations, and a fully styled footer. The project simulates the look and feel of a real e-learning platform, with sample course cards that display course titles, instructors, prices, ratings, and discount details.

This clone was created purely for educational purposes to practice frontend development skills. It integrates external resources such as Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons via CDN, adding a polished and modern visual appeal. While the project currently uses static HTML and CSS, it is structured in a way that makes it easy to scale further with JavaScript and backend functionality in the future.

The folder structure includes the main index.html file, a style.css file for styling, an Images/ directory containing course images and design elements, and optional pages like signup.html and contact.html. Users can clone this repository, open the index.html file in their browser, and immediately view the full website.

Future improvements may include adding JavaScript for interactive features such as login authentication, course search filtering, and responsive behavior for mobile screens. This project was developed by Mohamed Ansif, and is available publicly on GitHub to help others learn web development by example.
